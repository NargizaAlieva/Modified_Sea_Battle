# Modified_Sea_Battle

The game played on a single 7x7 field. 
The computer asks for the name of the player.
Then the program secretly from the player must place ships on the field: 1 ship of 3 squares, 2 ships of 2 squares and 4 ships of 1 square. The ships must not touch each other, even at their corners. 
An empty field is displayed on the console. The player enters the coordinates of the shot. If he misses, this cell should be marked as "miss". In case of a hit, this cell should be marked as "hit". If the ship is completely sunk, this automatically should be shown.

The marks on the field "miss", "hit", "sunk", as well as the empty cell â€“ all of this beautifully designed.
